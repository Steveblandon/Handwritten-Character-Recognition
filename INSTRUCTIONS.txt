open in matlab or octave (opensource version of matlab), the .m files can be ran in either, though it's best to run octave to avoid any complications.
open the autorun.m script to adjust hyperparameters like amount of neurons in the hidden layer, batch size, learning rate, epochs...etc. 
run the autorun.m script to see program in action.

Additionally you can run the following commands to run the best neural network we obtained:
==========================================================================================
testingSet = loadData(784);		//load testing set
[w1,b1,w2,b2] = loadNet("neuralNet8");	//load neural network
getAccuracy(testingSet,w1,b1,w2,b2)	//runs testing set through network and returns accuracy


for individual testing of samples:
==================================
getLabel(testingSet,5)			//the second parameter gets the sample label for any of the 10000 samples
sample = getSample(testingSet,5);	//get a sample from the testing
identify(sample,w1,b1,w2,b2)		//runs sample through network and gives best answer (with highest activation value)
